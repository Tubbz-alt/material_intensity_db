# Material intensity database project

***Work in progress – this repository will be part of a scientific publication.***

:floppy_disk:  Welcome to the Material Intensity Research Database MIR-DB! 

This database contains data on material intensity of buildings, but can be extended for further infrastructure in the future. The initial database version was assembled (seeded) by Heeren and Fishman (submitted). The publication provides some analysis of the data and discusses a number of applications for the database.

## Contributing

*Data contributions, and further extensions to the database are very much encouraged.* The more data is contained in the MIR-DB, the more meaningful analysis and can be made with it.

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info on how to contribute data. We encourage the use of the [liberated_data project](https://github.com/nheeren/liberated_data) if you are extracting data from non-portable, such as figures or tables in PDF files.

## Content

## TODO

- [ ] Determine if a line ending encoding could become an issue for this repo and discuss in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/10855862/2075003) and [here](https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings/) for more details on encoding and github)
- [ ] Discuss with Farnaz:
  - N/A vs NULL vs "". What to use when.
